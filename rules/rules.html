      <h2>Server Rules:</h2>
      <ol>
        <li>This server is specifically for help and advice for the CS topic.</li>
        <li>There is no NFSW allowed in this server and no foul language allowed in this server.</li>
        <li>As you learn you are also expected to be able to participate in helping the other beginners as well.</li>
        <li>Before asking our Helpers some questions... Pls check if the CS bot is online and has the info you need. The CS bot is a bot I personally made for you guys and it contains code that actually comes quite handy. So... check if the CS bot has it and if it does great... but if it doesn't then ask our Helpers! </li>
        <li>Skim through all channels to get a feel to the environment and what to do where...</li>
        <li>Read #questionetiquette before you ask any questions...</li>
        <li>Please message in an organized manner and in the right channels.</li>
        <li>Don't spam or piss our admin off...</li>
        <li>Don't ping me or my admins too much... And if you do... There shall be consequences.</li>
        <li>Use CSBot appropriately.</li>
        <li>Get some roles if you want to participate and type. Roles available in #get-roles</li>
        <li>Typing in #blackhole when CSBot is offline, is illegal.</li>
        <li>Advertising servers other than this one in the server is not ok!</li>
